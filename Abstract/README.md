# Abstract Assignments

This folder contains Java programs related to **abstract classes and methods**. These assignments help in understanding:

- The use of abstract classes and interfaces.
- Implementation of polymorphism using abstraction.
- Method overriding in abstract contexts.

Each `.java` file demonstrates real-life analogies and coding exercises based on abstract concepts.
